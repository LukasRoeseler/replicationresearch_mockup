## Free to read, free to publish

*Replication Research* is a Diamond Open Access Journal with strict and entirely transparent quality control and no author processing charges. We publish close and conceptual replications as well as reproductions.

## Valueing high-quality replication research

Replications should be the foundation for cumulative and quantitative science but they are not. We are here to change this. If you seek to publish replication research with rigorous and transparent quality assurance in an open and accessible way, we are here for you.

## Researcher-led

*Replication Research* is hosted by the University of Münster and maintained by the [Münster Center for Open Science (MüCOS)](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MueCOS/en/index.html) and the [Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT)](https://forrt.org).
