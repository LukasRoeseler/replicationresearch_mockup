## Free to read, free to publish

*Replication Research* is a Diamond Open Access Journal with strict and entirely transparent quality control and no author processing charges. We publish close and conceptual replications as well as reproductions.

## Valuing replication research

Replications should be the foundation for cumulative and quantitative science but they are not. We are here to change this. If you seek to publish high-quality replication research in an open and accessible way, we are here for you.

## Researcher-led

*Replication Research* is hosted by the University of M端nster and maintained by the [M端nster Center for Open Science (M端COS)](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MueCOS/en/index.html) and the [Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT)](https://forrt.org).
