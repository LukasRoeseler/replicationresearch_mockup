Articles need to disclose what original study and hypothesis/claim they replicated or reproduced. For an up-to-date overview of the disciplines from which we accept submissions, please see the editorial board. Generally, we can provide adequate quality assurance and peer-review for cognitive, behavioral, and social science studies (psychology, economics, sociology, education sciences, political sciences).\nPlease note that the entire review process is open and reviews will be permanently linked with submitted manuscripts via their DOIs and Pubpeer.com regardless whether the article is accepted or rejected. This is so that quality assurance is transparent, and so that work provided by reviewers for Replication Research is credited and not discarded.\n&gt;&gt; Submission Portal [LINK to OJS]"

Review for student reports is less strict and aimed to be faster (e.g., low-powered replications may be accepted if they discuss the limitations and provide useful new information such as reproduced materials or analysis plans). Reviews are still open and articles need to adhere to submission guidelines. Please note that students can also submit their articles as non-student reports."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Replication Research is an interdisciplinary journal for replication research. This includes reproductions, where the same code and data are used to verify the originally reported results, close replications, where new data is collected with a method closely resembling an original study, or conceptual replications, where a previously tested hypothesis is re-tested using new methods and new data. We currently accept replications from the social, cognitive, and behavioral sciences as well as medicine.\n\nDiamond Open Access without Processing Fees\nReplication Research is a researcher-led journal that is and will forever be free to read and to publish (Diamond Open Access, no Author Processing Charges).\n\n\nTruly Open Peer Review\nAll reviews are published after each round of peer-review, that is, regardless whether the manuscript is accepted or rejected for publication.\n\n\nReproducibility\nBefore publication, reproducibility checks are conducted for the reported results. Articles are not published unless these reproducibility checks are successful.\n\n\nArticle Types\nReplication Research accepts submissions that include reproducibility checks, internal or direct replications, close replications, and conceptual replications as long as the target study is specified and published.\nStudent first authors can but do not have to request \"student report\" status for their submissions, which results in less strict and faster peer review.\nFor more information, see the Submission Guidelines.
