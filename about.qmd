*Replication Research* is an interdisciplinary journal for replication research. This includes reproductions, where the same code and data are used to verify the originally reported results, close replications, where new data is collected with a method closely resembling an original study, or conceptual replications, where a previously tested hypothesis is re-tested using new methods and new data. We currently accept replications from the social, cognitive, and behavioral sciences as well as medicine.

## Diamond Open Access without Processing Fees

*Replication Research* is a researcher-led journal that is and will forever be free to read and to publish (Diamond Open Access, no Author Processing Charges).

## Open and Persistent Peer Review

All reviews are published after each round of peer-review, that is, regardless whether the manuscript is accepted or rejected for publication. Reviews are added as comments on the submitted preprint via [PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com).

## Reproducibility

Before publication, reproducibility checks are conducted for the reported results. Articles are not published unless these reproducibility checks are successful. This process is overseen by the reproducibility manager and conducted by the reproducibility team.

## Article Types

*Replication Research* accepts submissions that include reproducibility checks (including multiverse analyses and many analyst studies), internal or direct replications, close replications, and conceptual replications as long as the target study is specified and published.

Student first authors can but do not have to request "student report" status for their submissions. For these submissions, soft review deadlines are shorter (2 weeks instead of 4 weeks) and only a response from one reviewer is required. However, adherence to TOP guidelines (see below) and reproducibility check are still required.

For more information, see the [Submission Guidelines](https://lukasroeseler.github.io/replicationresearch_mockup/submissions.html).

## TOP Guidelines

The following table stems from the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/blog/new-preprint-introduces-major-update-to-the-top-guidelines). Replication Research requires level 3 adherence to Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines. Adherence to *TOP **Research Practices*** is checked by reviewers in a structured form that they are required to submit alongside their review. ***Verification Practices*** are organized by the journal, that is the reproducibility manager. *Replication Research* accepts all types of **Verification Studies**.
