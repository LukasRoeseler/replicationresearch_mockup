# Editorial Members' Conflict of Interest

For the foundation of Replication Research, we gathered experts on replication research from various disciplines. At the same time, replication research is conducted and published only rarely. This might lead to potential conflicts of interests, where members of the editorial team or their close colleagues submit research articles. For this reason, we require reviewers to disclose whether they have been working together with the author / one of the authors or with the handling editor.
