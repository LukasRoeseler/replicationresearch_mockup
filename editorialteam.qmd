# Editorial Members' Conflict of Interest

For the foundation of Replication Research, we gathered experts on replication research from various disciplines. At the same time, replication research is conducted and published only rarely. This might lead to potential conflicts of interests, where members of the editorial team or their close colleagues submit research articles. For this reason, we require reviewers to disclose whether they have been working together with the author / one of the authors or with the handling editor. If an editor is a co-author in a submitted manuscript, they must include a COI statement and a different editor must handle the submission.

# *Replication Research* Network

In summer 2024, an international network of researchers has finalized a research proposal for the foundation of a publication platform for replication research. This journal concept is embedded into this. The proposal is openly available:

Please get in touch if you are interested in supporting this endeavour or if you would like to keep updated on it. The current timeline is detailed in the figure below and is subject to change.
